Churn Modelling using Logistic Regression v/s Deep Learning

Using churn modelling data for bank - https://www.kaggle.com/aakash50897/churn-modellingcsv

The idea was to check model comparison, for a binominal variable of churning, using basic logistic regression (code is commented) 
and using Deep Learning using keras and tensor flow. The results were interesting. 
Basic Logit - accuracy around 80%, using DL - using two hidden layers - accuracy increased to 83% and again increased hidden layer 
by one more, accuracy increased to 80%
